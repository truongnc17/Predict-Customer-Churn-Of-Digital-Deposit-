# Predict-Customer-Churn-Of-Digital-Deposit-
This project aims to **explore and define the concept of churn customers** within the context of customers **utilizing the "Heo So" service.**
In this particular study, the **definition of a churn customer** has been established based on specific criteria. 
The analysis relies on the recorded data from the system, specifically **focusing on two key factors: the decrease in the number of customer logins on the "Heo Sá»‘" app and the customer's savings balance on the same app.** 
By observing changes in these variables between March 2021 and June 2021, churn customers can be identified within the dataset.
